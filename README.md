# EPOT tools

## Local deployment

### Create virtualenv and install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup your Jira access
```bash
cp config.ini.example config.ini
# edit config.ini and set username and password to the ones you use
```
 

### With virtualenv active:
```bash

python epot.py  # see list of supported commands

python epot.py show-resource --help  # example of getting help for a specific command

Examples:

python epot.py refresh-cache  # to get the latest list of providers and resources
python epot.py list-providers -n Tartu  # to get a list of providers with optional filter by name
python epot.py show-provider -n Tartu -v  # to see more detailed view of provider
python epot.py list-resources -n Rock  # to see more a list of resources
python epot.py show-resource -n 'UT Rocket' -p Tartu 
```

### Auditing assist tool

To simplify process of checking for existing auditing records, a command has been added that checks for open
issues and status of the records. Command also performs basic automatic validation. Two examples are below.
Note that by default it runs with 'dry-run', pass --no-dry_run and make sure that you have correct Jira
credentials configured to create actual tickets.

```bash
$ python epot.py check-eoscob-tasks --dry_run -p Tartu
